# **Burger Maker:**

### **Project Description:**

An app that utilizes a MySQL to store burgers that are made and consumed by a user.

### **Getting Started:**

Check out the deployed version here: https://burgermaker38.herokuapp.com/

### **How to Use:**

Type the name of a burger you would like to create inside of the text field. Click the "add your burger" button to add your new burger to the MySQL database and list, which is then added to the list of created burgers. If you want to eat a burger, then press the "eat me" button to remove the corresponding burger from the ceated list. All eaten burgers have their eaten status changed in the MySQL database and are switched over to the eaten list.

### **Prerequisites:**

MySQL database

### **Installing:**

If you wish to run the application locally, then clone the files onto your computer. In the command line of Command Prompt or Git Bash, while in the base folder of the app directory, type the command "npm install". Ensure that your MySQL database is up and running. Under the config folder inside the app, there is a file named connection.js. Within the connection file, change the password to your MySQL password. Once all the required packages have been installed, type "npm start" to run the application.
